# HeSuVi File Virtualizer
Script that applies HeSuVi virtual surround to 7.1 input files.

[Binaural audio in a nutshell](https://kutt.it/binaural)

# Requirements
- [HeSuVi installed](https://sourceforge.net/p/hesuvi/wiki/Help/).
- Input sample rate needs to match HeSuVi HRIRs' (44100hz or 48000hz).

# Guide
- Drag and drop file onto the script then press Enter, and follow the instructions.
- To change settings (HRIRs/output format/bitrate/extra arguments), press Enter without providing input.  
  - Settings are saved to an INI file for future sessions.

# Notes:
- Extra WAV files in the script folder will be added as new tracks without applying extra virtualization, using filename without extension as label.  
- Only input file's main video track will be used, and copied without re-encoding.  
- Only input file's main audio track will be used, re-encoded only if required (MP4).  
- While processing, HeSuVi will be turned on and cycle through HRIRs, which also applies to system audio.  

# Usage:
You can use this script to:
- Add a pre-virtualized 7.1 track to a movie to watch on a portable device or on the go.
- Compare surround virtualization software, either [just the audio](https://airtable.com/shrTudzDGTsVR7p7p/tbloLjoZKWJDnLtTc), or [gameplay](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/RNK9HAzbAhD9funBsp6Emt?).
